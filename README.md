## 💡 Inspiration / What Inspired the Project

I created UrbanStyles to sharpen my frontend development and UI/UX design skills.
As someone passionate about clean, user-focused web experiences, I wanted to design an e-commerce platform that looks and feels like a real store.
The goal was to:

 - Strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
 - Simulate real e-commerce functionality (cart, checkout, product pages).
